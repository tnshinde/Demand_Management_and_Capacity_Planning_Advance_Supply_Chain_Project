🚚 **Drizly (Uber Eats)** Supply Chain Optimization & Analysis 📊

This project focuses on optimizing Drizly's last-mile delivery operations based on data analysis and strategic recommendations. By leveraging Excel for data insights and applying best practices from supply chain management, this project aims to enhance efficiency, customer satisfaction, and profitability.

🛠️ ** Project Overview**
The goal of this project is to analyze Drizly's delivery data to identify areas for improvement in last-mile logistics. This includes optimizing delivery routes, enhancing customer communication, and implementing targeted marketing strategies for high-value customers. The analysis was performed using Excel to derive actionable insights that can be implemented in stages.

🔍 **Key Findings**
Based on the analysis, the following areas were identified as critical for optimizing delivery operations:

High delivery costs during peak times due to inefficient route planning.
Lack of proactive communication leading to reduced customer satisfaction.
Underutilization of high-GMV (Gross Merchandise Value) customer segments.
Opportunities to boost sales through personalized upselling at checkout.
